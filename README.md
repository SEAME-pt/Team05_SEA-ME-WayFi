Distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry are complex systems that combine hardware, software, and networking components to create advanced and highly integrated systems for vehicles. These systems typically include a wide range of components, including microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and communication networks.

One of the key features of distributed embedded systems is their use of multiple microcontrollers, each of which is responsible for a specific function or task. For example, one microcontroller may be responsible for controlling the engine, while another may be responsible for controlling the infotainment system. These microcontrollers are connected through a communication network, such as Controller Area Network (CAN) or Local Interconnect Network (LIN), which enables them to exchange data and collaborate to achieve the desired behavior of the vehicle.

Another important aspect of distributed embedded systems is the use of software. This includes both low-level software, such as drivers and firmware, and high-level software, such as user interfaces and applications. The software used in these systems must be highly reliable and performant, as it is responsible for critical functions such as safety and performance.

The use of networking technologies, such as Ethernet and VSOMEIP/CommonAPI, is also critical for distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry. These technologies enable vehicles to connect to other vehicles, to infrastructure, and to the internet, creating a highly connected and intelligent mobility ecosystem.

The development of distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry requires a deep understanding of a wide range of technologies, including hardware, software, and networking. Additionally, it requires close collaboration between hardware and software engineers, as well as designers and testers, to ensure that the systems are reliable, performant, and meet the complex requirements of the industry and users.

Overall, distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry are critical components of the modern vehicle, and play a key role in enabling the development of advanced and highly integrated systems for vehicles. Whether it is for safety, performance, connectivity, or entertainment, these systems are essential for delivering a high-quality and innovative driving experience.
